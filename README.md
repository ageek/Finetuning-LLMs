2. FT Openllama 3b v2 on 'Red dot product description' to generate product description for 'suggested' products.
3. FT Mistral 7B on Instruction dataset : MosaicML to generate possible question for a given description text
4. FT Unsloth Mistral 7B on Alpaca dataset. Unsloth provides quantized models which load faster and consume less memory during training and inference.
